# BreweryFinder
The BreweryFinder SPA connects breweries with drinkers.

Brewers can maintain detailed, searchable profiles for their establishments. This includes the ability to add and update their full drink selections, as well as the ability to post any upcoming events that they are hosting.

Drinkers can find the breweries or specific beers they are looking for in a variety of ways. Breweries can be filtered using anything from location to whether food is served to if the allow dogs.

Similarly, beers can be filtered (no pun intended) both by text-based search and ABV. If you've already tried a beer, feel free leave a review.

Events can also be filtered by date range and whether or not they are 21+.

## Future updates
- Ability for drinkers to add photos they have taken and post them to a brewery's page
